<p align="center"><img width="50%"  src="images/Screenshot-2.png" alt="OnePlus 6T"> </p>
<p>The OnePlus 6T (codenamed _"fajita"_) is an Android-based smartphone from OnePlus. It was announced on October 29, 2018, before being released on November 6. The OnePlus 6T is an incremental hardware update to the prior OnePlus 6. Namely through increasing the size of the display along with the device's screen-to-body ratio (to 6.41" and by about 2% respectively) by slightly shrinking the bottom "chin" bezel and using a taller, 19.5:9 AMOLED panel with more heavily curved corners & significantly smaller "teardrop" shaped "notch". This is in addition to the 6T's other major changes which includes increasing the size of the battery, removing the 3.5 mm audio jack, and providing a new optical in-display fingerprint sensor. OnePlus also announced a McLaren edition of the phone in December 2018.<br></p>
